"Write a LinkedIn post that shares [your main topic/insight/experience].
Keep it professional yet conversational.
Use a strong hook in the first 2 lines to grab attention.
Break ideas into short, scannable sentences and use spacing for readability.
Make it relatable by connecting the idea to everyday work/life situations.
End with either a takeaway, lesson, or a question to encourage engagement.
Keep the tone authentic, positive, and insightful â€” not salesy."
